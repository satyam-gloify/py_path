31 & 32 Aspect	os.mkdir	os.makedirs
Creates Intermediate Dirs	No (raises FileNotFoundError)	Yes (creates all missing directories)
Single vs Nested Dirs	Single directory only	Handles both single and nested dirs
Handles Existing Dir	Raises FileExistsError	Optional (exist_ok=True avoids error)
Use Case	Simple directory creation	Building complex directory structures


33. minor(device) & major(device)
In Unix-like systems, device files are special files in the /dev directory that represent hardware devices (e.g., disks, terminals, printers). These files are associated with a device ID, which consists of two parts:

Major Number: Identifies the type of device (e.g., disk, terminal).
Minor Number: Identifies a specific device instance within that type (e.g., a specific disk partition).
Use Case: Helps identify the type of device associated with the device ID.
device: A device ID, typically retrieved using os.stat() or os.lstat() on a device file.
import os
# Path to a device file
device_path = "/dev/sda"
# Get metadata about the device file
stat_info = os.stat(device_path)
# Extract the major and minor device numbers
major_number = os.major(stat_info.st_rdev)
print("Major Number:", major_number)
Example: 8 typically corresponds to SCSI disk devices on Linux.
- System Administration:
System tools or scripts can use the major number to group or categorize devices in /dev.
- Custom Device Drivers: When creating custom device drivers, major numbers are assigned to the driver to define its device type.
How Device IDs Work
Device IDs are stored in a special attribute of a file's metadata called st_rdev. You can retrieve it using os.stat() or os.lstat().

Example of Device ID Decomposition
import os
# Path to a device file
device_path = "/dev/sda"
# Get metadata about the device file
stat_info = os.stat(device_path)
# Extract major and minor numbers
major_number = os.major(stat_info.st_rdev)
minor_number = os.minor(stat_info.st_rdev)
print("Device ID:", stat_info.st_rdev)
print("Major Number:", major_number)
print("Minor Number:", minor_number)
Output (example):
Device ID: 2048
Major Number: 8
Minor Number: 0
Here:
Major Number 8: Represents a block storage device (SCSI disk).
Minor Number 0: Represents the first disk (/dev/sda).

List of Major Device Numbers by Category
1. Block Devices (Storage)
Block devices are devices that store data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., disks).
Device	Major Number	Description
SCSI Disk Drives	8	For devices like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb (hard drives).
IDE Disk Drives	3	Legacy IDE hard drives (/dev/hda, /dev/hdb).
NVMe Drives	259	Modern NVMe storage devices.
Loopback Devices	7	Virtual block devices (/dev/loop0, /dev/loop1).
RAM Disk	1	In-memory block devices (/dev/ram0).
USB Mass Storage	189	USB drives (external storage).
