Master Core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python

Before diving into AI, you need a strong grasp of Python’s foundational Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). These are essential because they form the basis for handling large datasets, improving algorithmic performance, and optimizing AI models.

Key Concepts to Learn:

Arrays, Lists, Tuples, and Sets: Understand how to manipulate these structures in Python, their time and space complexities, and when to use each.
Stacks and Queues: Learn their use cases in algorithms, like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
Hash Tables (Dictionaries in Python): These are crucial for quick lookups, such as in the implementation of AI algorithms.
Linked Lists and Trees: Learn about binary trees, AVL trees, and heaps. These are critical in implementing search and optimization algorithms used in AI.
Graphs and Algorithms: Learn graph theory concepts like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall, and Bellman-Ford, which are crucial in pathfinding problems in AI.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Implement quicksort, mergesort, binary search, and others to prepare for working with datasets.
